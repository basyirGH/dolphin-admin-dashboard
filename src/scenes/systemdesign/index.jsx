                        Recently, I've been upskilling and learning with Dolphin. This project is a full stack implementation that began in Dec 2024 using React.js and Java Spring Boot. Having been involved in an impactful statistics project before, I was inspired to create Dolphinâ€”while also taking the event-driven programming approach with WebSocket instead of conventional CRUD and REST APIs.
